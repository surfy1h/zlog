Setting up Slack App to get the token needed for this reporter:

1. **Create a Slack App**:
   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Click "Create New App"
   - Choose "From scratch"
   - Name your app and select your workspace

2. **Add Bot Token Scopes**:
   - In the left sidebar, click "OAuth & Permissions"
   - Scroll to "Scopes" section
   - Under "Bot Token Scopes", add these permissions:
     - `chat:write` (to send messages)
     - `chat:write.public` (to send messages to channels without joining)

3. **Install App to Workspace**:
   - Scroll up to "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace"
   - Click "Install to Workspace"
   - Authorize the app

4. **Get the Bot Token**:
   - After installation, you'll see "Bot User OAuth Token"
   - It starts with `xoxb-`
   - Copy this token

5. **Configure Your Code**:
```go
config := ReportConfig{
    Type:     "slack",
    Token:    "xoxb-your-token-here",
    FlushSec: 3,
    MaxCount: 20,
}
```

6. **Invite Bot to Channel**:
   - In Slack, go to the channel where you want to receive reports
   - Type `/invite @YourBotName`

**Note**: 
- Keep your bot token secret
- Consider using environment variables or secure configuration management
- The token should start with `xoxb-` (Bot User OAuth Token)
- Make sure the bot is invited to the channels where it needs to post

Would you like me to show you how to implement the actual Slack message sending logic in the `SlackWriter.Write()` method?
